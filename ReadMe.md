### This is the Matlab code for generateing main figs in the following paper:

* All the results are generated by applying SoptSC to the single-cell RNA-seq data, for detailed useage of SoptSC, please refer to
https://github.com/WangShuxiong/SoptSC
* Some figures are generated using custermized code below


* Key features of SoptSC
	> 1. Estimation of the number of clusters from the single-cell data.
	> 2. Identify cell subpopulations.
	> 3. Identify marker genes for each cell subpopulation.
	> 4. Infer pseudotime (temporal ordering of cells) in an unsupervised manner: i.e., initial cell is not required.
	> 5. Infer lineage in an unsupervised manner: i.e., initial cluster is not required. 
	> 6. Infer signaling network given a group of Ligand-Receptor pairs and their downstream target genes (to be updated).
	----------------------

- Requires: 
	> MATLAB R2017b or later (where function tSNE is included)
	> or Update the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox such that the function tSNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is included.
	> Please refer to each M file for more detailed descriptions of the corresponding function.
