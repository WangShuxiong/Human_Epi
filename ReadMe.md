## This is the Matlab code for generateing main figs in the following paper:


* All the results are generated by applying SoptSC to the single-cell RNA-seq data, for detailed useage of SoptSC, please refer to
https://github.com/WangShuxiong/SoptSC
* Some figures are generated using custermized code below



- Requires: 
	> - MATLAB R2017b or later (where function tSNE is included)
	> - or Update the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox such that the function tSNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is included.
	> - Please refer to each M file for more detailed descriptions of the corresponding function.
